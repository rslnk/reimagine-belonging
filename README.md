## Installation and development setup

The following documentation contains step by step instructions on how to install project on your local machine and should help you get started with [Reimagine Belonging](http://www.reimaginebelonging.org) website development.

### Requirements

* Git
* PHP >= 5.4
* Node.js >= 0.10 — [Install](https://nodejs.org/download)
* npm >=2.1.5 — [Install](https://www.npmjs.com/package/latest-version)
* Gulp (`npm install -g gulp`)
* Bower (`npm install -g bower`)

### Development server

To setup development machine compatible with all Reimagine Belonging websites clone/fork our [trellis-reimaginebelonging](https://bitbucket.org/rslnk/trellis-reimaginebelonging/overview) solution. Ask project's administrator to provide you with an access to this repo.

### Development setup

This project uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) as its build system and [Bower](http://bower.io) to manage front-end packages. To get started with the building process make sure your development machine meets the following requirements:

| Prerequisite    | Check version | How to install
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Node.js 0.12.x  | `node -v`     | [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) |
| gulp >= 3.8.10  | `gulp -v`     | `npm install -g gulp` |
| Bower >= 1.3.12 | `bower -v`    | `npm install -g bower` |

We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

**Install Gulp, Bower and build dependencies:**

1. Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io) globally with `npm install -g gulp bower`
2. Navigate to the theme directory `web/app/themes/theme/`, then run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

## Project structure

Reimagine Belonging website utilizes [Bedrock project organization](https://github.com/roots/bedrock/wiki/Folder-structure), which is similar to putting WordPress in its own subdirectory:

* All required files are stored in `web/` directory including the vendor'd `wp/` source, and the `wp-content` source.
* `wp-content` has been named `app` to better reflect its contents.
* `wp-config.php` remains in the `web/` because it's required by WordPress, but it only acts as a loader. The actual configuration files have been moved to `config/` for better separation.
* `vendor/` is where the Composer managed dependencies are installed to.
* `wp/` is where the WordPress core lives.

    └── wp/
```

Note: `config/application.php` is the main config file that contains what `wp-config.php` usually would. Base options are set in there.

## Website development

Reimagine Belonging WordPress theme files are stored in `web/app/themes/theme/`. To start working on the development or run building process use:

### Available Gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `gulp --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).
* `gulp --tasks` — Lists all the available tasks and what they do

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `gulp watch` your local development hostname should be set to `http://reimaginebelonging.dev` to reflect `devUrl` set at the bottom of `assets/manifest.json`.

### Application folder structure

### Managing WordPress dependencies with Composer

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is used to manage any 3rd party library like WordPress plugins as a dependency including WordPress itself.

All plugins required for Reimagine Belonging to run delcared in `/composer.json` file. Any new plugin must be added under the `require` directive. Namespace  for WordPress plugins from WordPress Packagist is always `wpackagist-plugin`.

Whenever a new plugin is being added or the WordPress version updated, a `composer update` command should be run in order to install new packages.

`plugins`, and `mu-plugins` are Git ignored by default since Composer manages them. Custom plugins that *aren't* managed by Composer, are whitelisted in `/.gitignore` file.

## Must-use plugins

The following must-use WordPress plugins are required in order for Reimagine Belonging website to work:

* Base Setup >= 1.0
* [Soil](https://roots.io/plugins/soil) >= 3.3.0
* [ACF PRO](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro) >= 5.2.5

### Base Setup plugin

Site specific mu-plugin that automatically sets the following WordPress defaults:

* Sets upload path to /media;
* Sets upload path URL to example.com/media
* Disables year/month folder structure for uploads
* Sets permalink structure to post name
* Creates data api endpoint URL
* Sets save/load path to ACF PRO JSON custom fields

### Bedrock Autoloader plugin

An autoloader that enables standard plugins to be required just like must-use plugins. The autoloaded plugins are included after all mu-plugins and standard plugins have been loaded.

### Disallow Indexing plugin

Disallow indexing on non-production environments.

### Soil plugin

[Soil](https://roots.io/plugins/soil) is a WordPress plugin which contains a collection of modules to apply theme-agnostic front-end modifications.

* Loads jQuery from Google’s CDN with a local fallback (as recommended by HTML5 Boilerplate)
* Cleaner output of WordPress `wp_head` and enqueued assets
* Cleaner output of walker for WordPress navigation menus
* Replaces WordPress absolute URLs with root relative URLs
* Redirects search results from /?s=query to /search/query/
* Support for HTML5 Boilerplate’s Google Analytics snippet
* Forces all WordPress enqueued JavaScript to the footer
* Globally disables trackbacks and pingbacks
* Removes the version query string from all styles and scripts.

### ACF PRO plugin
